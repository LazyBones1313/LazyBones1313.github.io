    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;margin-top:5%;margin-left: 5%;margin-right: 5%;text-align:center;color: #50ff4c;background-color: #09f;padding: 25px;border-radius: 50%;">Microsoft has been constantly making hardware ever since the company was first created. As things continue to develop, when it comes to the gaming industry, here's the current list of hardware.</p>

        <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/accessories/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller" class="brand"><img style="width: 50%;" src="https://github.com/LazyBones1313/LazyBones1313.github.io/blob/main/images/xbox%20controller.png?raw=true" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/accessories/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller"alt="Logo image" /></a>
        <h1 style="color: orange;font-size: 20px;">Controllers</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #09f;color:white;margin-top: 2%;padding: 5px;">There has been tons of new controllers microsoft makes throughout the years, currently, the xbox one controller is used for their latest games, despite the xbox one not being the latest console, the newer consoles use them since they had a great design. With bluetooth you can even use them on pc, thankfully, Valve's steam software supports xbox one controllers officially and lots of games including microsoft's games already have controller support. To purchase one, click the controller.</p>
        <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/all-consoles?xr=shellnav" class="brand"><img style="width: 50%;margin-top: 5%;" src="https://github.com/LazyBones1313/LazyBones1313.github.io/blob/main/images/htc%20vive.png?raw=true" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/all-consoles?xr=shellnav"alt="Logo image" /></a>
        <h1 style="color: orange;font-size: 20px;">Consoles</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #09f;color:white;margin-top: 2%;padding: 5px;">In late 2015 and early 2016, Valve was experimenting with Virtual Reality Technology. In the past like everyone else all video games were on a flat screen while the user had a keyboard and mouse, a controller (or steam controller). Now they realized they can immerse players even more if they made games for a special kind of hardware, whether this hardware counts as a console is debatable since it still relies on a powerful pc to run these games. So Valve partnered up with HTC (a smartphone company) to make a competitor to the only vr headset on the market being the oculus rift. It's called: "The HTC VIVE", a vr headset you attach to your computer and run a special software on steam called steam VR, here you enter a virtual house you can customize and play vr games on steam made for this headset, some vr games even support other headsets like the oculus rift, mixed reality, and other headsets. The headset also had a built in camera so you can press a button in the steam vr menu and see the real world through the camera as if you weren't wearing the headset so you don't have to take it off (the camera displays everything in blue). Included with the headset are two controllers called vive wands (one for each hand) that each have an analog trigger, a trackpad, and a couple buttons. It also comes with two cube shaped cameras called "Base Stations". These base stations are designed to track the physical position of the headset and wands so the game knows where you are in the real world and moves your avatar accordingly. They released this headset along with a free to download vr game on steam called "The Lab" which experiments with vr technology. Later, they came out with newer versions of the headset called "The HTC Vive pro" with had two cameras on the headset instead of one for 3d effects, and overall improved quality. Later, they made "The Vive pro 2" wich is just another improvement to the previous versions. There is also a wireless adapter sold seperately you can buy which allows you to remove the cable and play wirelessly without worrying about the annoying cables. These headsets are quite expensive as the original costed $600 upon release, but awesome, depending on your current income, you can either get this headset, a more expensive one, or a cheaper one. To get a vr headset, shop for them on google steam or amazon. To get a regular vive, click the headset.</p>

        <h1 style="color: orange;font-size: 20px;">The Valve Index</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #09f;color:white;margin-top: 2%;padding: 5px;">Long after the HTC Vives were made. Valve seperated from HTC to make a headset of thier own. They took the headset of the HTC vive and developed special controllers called "The Knuckles Controllers" which were special controllers with straps where rather than holding it like a wii remote you put your hand in like a glove without fingers. As the point of this headset is to not only add joysticks to the controllers, but make the controller able to TRACK YOUR FINGERS! So now you can move your individual fingers around and the game would pick up on that. The grip buttons are much larger and have now become analog, so it knows how HARD you are squeezing. These controllers came with a free (but very well hidden) game only for those who have these controllers (as you can't use them with other headsets) called: "Moondust", a game that takes place in the portal universe where aperture needs more conversion gel so they need more moon rocks, so they send a robot (you) to the moon to collect more, along with some fun tests. This game is another "The Lab" but for these controllers as it is more tech experimentation like squeezing the rocks in the filter so it tests the analog grips. Later, when these controllers became public, they came with a headset made for these controllers even better than the vive pro 2 using the mixed reality headset design plus 2 improved basestations. This headset collection became "The Valve Index" Which can be bought on steam for $1,000. It's expensive because it's incredibly well made. When it became public, so did moondust, and they made it compatable for other vr headsets so they can make another game using these controllers called "Aperture hand lab" which is another portal game that has you interact with spherical robots with arms as you test out real hand interaction with the robots. You're probably not made of money but if you could afford this item and want one, click on the headset to get one.</p>
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/" class="brand"><img style="width: 50%;margin-top: 5%;" src="https://github.com/LazyBones1313/LazyBones1313.github.io/blob/main/images/steam%20deck.png?raw=true" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/"alt="Logo image" /></a>
        <h1 style="color: orange;font-size: 20px;">The Steam Deck</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #09f;color:white;margin-top: 2%;padding: 5px;">While valve is mainly focusing on VR technology for their upcoming games. After the release of Half-Life: Alyx, a AAA VR exclusive video game in the half-life universe, they realized how people like playing portable games with them. So they split the team in half, one team continues vr tech while the other team works on portable tech. Together they work on upcoming project like the rumored "Citadel", a vr flat screen hybrid half-life game they mainly work seperate. Now the flat screen team saw how successful the Nintendo Switch was, so to allow players to take their valve games with them on vacations too, they made the steam deck. Effectively, a powerful gaming portable console using SteamOS, a steam based linux engine. While it's possible to run Windows 10 on this device, it's debatable of whether the transition is worth it. There are three types of versions on steam, the more expensive ones are better in quality so they have both good quality and cheap versions of the product. Using aspects of the steam controller they made the hardware compatable to use for MOST pc games on steam. Some however just will not work no matter what, ESPECIALLY VR games. This product was such a major success however that they are already sold out despite the product not even releasing. They even had to delay the release from December 2021 to February 2022. If you want to pre-order one, click the steam deck.</p>
