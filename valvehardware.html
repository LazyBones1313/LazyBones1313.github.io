        <h1 style="color: orange;font-size: 20px;">The Steam Controller</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #09f;color:white;margin-top: 2%;padding: 5px;">The Steam Controller was invented specifically for the steam platform on computers. It was special because valve saw controllers as inferior to keyboard and mouse. Since valve's vision is to let players turn their pc's into consoles they attempted to create a special controller that would have a trackpad to function like a mouse. It's like a controller version of a keyboard and mouse. While this did sound amazing on paper it wasn't well executed and most of the majority of the public don't like the product very much. There are however still thousands of people out there who still like this product because they liked the concept. It's not a bad product, just not a product that everyone wanted. It really boils down to personal opinion of if it's good. If you want one of your own, click the controller to go to the steam page.</p>

        <h1 style="color: orange;font-size: 20px;">The HTC Vive</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #09f;color:white;margin-top: 2%;padding: 5px;">In late 2015 and early 2016, Valve was experimenting with Virtual Reality Technology. In the past like everyone else all video games were on a flat screen while the user had a keyboard and mouse, a controller (or steam controller). Now they realized they can immerse players even more if they made games for a special kind of hardware, whether this hardware counts as a console is debatable since it still relies on a powerful pc to run these games. So Valve partnered up with HTC (a smartphone company) to make a competitor to the only vr headset on the market being the oculus rift. It's called: "The HTC VIVE", a vr headset you attach to your computer and run a special software on steam called steam VR, here you enter a virtual house you can customize and play vr games on steam made for this headset, some vr games even support other headsets like the oculus rift, mixed reality, and other headsets. The headset also had a built in camera so you can press a button in the steam vr menu and see the real world through the camera as if you weren't wearing the headset so you don't have to take it off (the camera displays everything in blue). Included with the headset are two controllers called vive wands (one for each hand) that each have an analog trigger, a trackpad, and a couple buttons. It also comes with two cube shaped cameras called "Base Stations". These base stations are designed to track the physical position of the headset and wands so the game knows where you are in the real world and moves your avatar accordingly. They released this headset along with a free to download vr game on steam called "The Lab" which experiments with vr technology. Later, they came out with newer versions of the headset called "The HTC Vive pro" with had two cameras on the headset instead of one for 3d effects, and overall improved quality. Later, they made "The Vive pro 2" wich is just another improvement to the previous versions. There is also a wireless adapter sold seperately you can buy which allows you to remove the cable and play wirelessly without worrying about the annoying cables. These headsets are quite expensive as the original costed $600 upon release, but awesome, depending on your current income, you can either get this headset, a more expensive one, or a cheaper one. To get a vr headset, shop for them on google steam or amazon. To get a regular vive, click the headset.</p>
